            <h2>Guest Lectures at F&C</h2>
            <p>Aside from hosting Monday evenings at 14 Palmers Road, <span class="imptext">I’d also like to host the space for 60-90 minutes on
            Wednesday evenings for guest speakers to come in</span>.
            <br><br>
            These sessions will be <span class="imptext">a chance for anyone in London to receive focused instruction</span> about the week’s
            featured subject. Example tutorial titles might include: “Recursion in JavaScript”, “Designing Responsive Page Layouts”, “Setting up your Coding Environment
            to Maximise Productivity” and “Animation with CSS”.
            <br><br>
            I hope to make Wednesdays into something very <span class="imptext">meaningful for our local community</span>.</p>

            <h2>Tutoring</h2>
            <p> I have a particular passion for teaching and have already begun <span class="imptext">free tutoring
            sessions</span> for two kids in London. I have years of experience <span class="imptext">working with children</span>, am deeply
            skilled at teaching <span class="imptext">STEM topics</span>, and
            can also easily teach <span class="imptext">English</span>, <span class="imptext">French</span>, <span class="imptext">German</span> and <span class="imptext">Spanish</span>. I plan on
            continuing my free tutoring for those who need it well into 2017 and beyond.
            <br><br>
            I have also spoken to other applicants about <span class="imptext">bringing outdoor-skills education to Londoners by
            leading weekend camping trips</span>. I’ve led such trips for over 6 years as I’ve worked extensively
            in the outdoor education and summer camping industries in Canada.

            <h2>Tiny-home Shelters</h2>
            <p>One of my goals for 2017 is to <span class="imptext">improve my carpentry skills</span>. To that end, I'm actively looking
            to <span class="imptext">partner with a local carpenter</span> (and possibly fellow cohort members) to <span class="imptext">build small, portable
            shelters for London's homeless</span>.
            <br><br>
            These so-called "tiny houses" are immensely popular as side-projects and getaway cabin retreats
            in Canada - I don't see any reason not to build one for somebody who could use it here!
            I'm really looking forward to tackling this as a weekend side project and learning new skills
            along the way.</p>

            <h2 class="apptitles">App 1.</h2>
            <h2>Community Skill-building</h2>
            <p><span class="imptext">A web app that pairs people who want to learn a new skill with mentors</span> who
             offer their time for free - because they want to help out.
             <br><br>A prospective teacher describes their skills and availability.
             Students then submit applications to work alongside them.
             The website is meant to <span class="imptext">connect experience with hunger for knowledge</span>.
             <br><br>e.g. Why not connect a retired carpenter with someone yearning to learn how to build?
             <span class="imptext">Our communities are wonderful resources - <em>let's make use of them</em></span>.</p>

            <h2 class="apptitles">App 2.</h2>
            <h2>Community Bonds</h2>
            <p>An app that connects strangers for spontaneous friendly coffee breaks. I plan to <span class="imptext">partner with local cafés
            around London</span> to offer users discounted prices when they <span class="imptext">treat each other to a cashless
            coffee</span> through the app.
            <br><br> Imagine opening your phone and seeing a map full of dots denoting nearby app users.
            Your map tends to display those people who recently treated someone else to a coffee, in addition to app
            friends-of-friends who happen to be nearby. Click on their name and you've invited them to a free
            coffee session two minutes away!
            <br><br> Let's use the bonding power of the coffee bean to <span class="imptext">bring together elements of a community that might otherwise never intersect</span>.

            <h2 class="apptitles">App 3.</h2>
            <h2>Community Transportation</h2>
            <p>North America has <span class="imptext">high transportation costs</span> and virtually no mainstream ride-sharing apps for inter-city travel.
             It's a huge untapped field of opportunity.
             <br><br>My app will soon <span class="imptext">allow people to advertise unused seats in their car</span> when they travel long distances.
             The free market will determine seat prices, but I expect them to be significantly lower than buses or trains,
             as is the case with similar apps on the European market.
             <br><br>I cannot wait to offer North Americans a cheaper, more environmentally-friendly and convivial way
             to travel with others.</p>

            <h2>Phase 1. Solo</h2>
            <p>Every journey of discovery begins alone and quickly snowballs into a group venture.
            <span class="imptext">My coding journey started almost three months ago in Montreal</span> with a solo decision to improve my programming
            skills from zero to where they are now.
            <br><br>Fast-forward to now and <span class="imptext">I've spent the last two months in London learning to code</span> with
            a wonderful community of like-minded people. It feels amazing to type this HTML right now!

            <h2>Phase 2. Founders & Coders</h2>
            <p>My next phase is joining F&C full-time with the February cohort. I've attended virtually
            every meetup of the last two months and know and love the open, industrious, cross-disciplinary,
            community-driven (but self-directed) atmosphere. <span class="imptext">I want to keep giving and learning here in London</span>.
            <br><br>My favourite moment thus far has been <span class="imptext">teaching 25 other F&C community members how to use
            Git and GitHub</span>. It was an immensely rewarding opportunity to give back to a community that has already given
            so much to me - I certainly welcome the chance to give more tutorials to the community in 2017!

            <h2>Phase 3. Start-ups</h2>
            <p><span class="imptext">I plan to apply to London-based tech start-ups and mid-sized companies</span> while attending F&C in Q1 2017.
            I want the opportunity to be a big fish in a small pond: to have lots of responsibility, but access to
            experienced coworkers to learn and grow from.
            <br><br>While working in the start-up scene, I want to <span class="imptext">remain engaged with the rest of the tech community</span>,
            principally through F&C, to continue developing my own app ideas - a sampling of which are listed in the previous
            section.</p>
