            <h2>Community Skills</h2>
            <p>A web app that pairs people who want to learn a new skill with mentors who
             offer their time for free - because they want to help out.
             <br><br>A prospective teacher describes their skills and availability.
             Students then submit applications.
             The website is meant to connect experience with hunger for knowledge.
             <br><br>e.g. Why not connect a retired carpenter with someone yearning to learn how to build?
             Our communities are wonderful resources - <em>let's make use of them</em>.</p>

            <h2>Community Bonds</h2>
            <p>An app that connects strangers for spontaneous friendly coffee breaks. I plan to partner with local caf√©s
            around London to offer users discounted prices when they treat each other to a cashless
            coffee through the app.
            <br><br> Imagine opening your phone and seeing a map full of dots denoting nearby app users.
            Your map tends to display those who recently treated someone else to a coffee, in addition to app
            friends-of-friends who happen to be nearby. Click on their name and you've invited them to a free
            coffee two minutes away!
            <br><br>Of course, personal profiles and messaging capabilities are built into the app.
            Within a few weeks you find yourself with a parallel, real-life social network thanks to
            the bonding power of the coffee bean. The point of this app is not necessarily dating, but to bring
            together people in a community who might never intersect otherwise.

            <h2>Community Transportation</h2>
            <p>North America has high transportation costs and virtually no ride-sharing apps for inter-city travel.
             It's a <strong>huge</strong></p> untapped field of opportunity.
             <br><br>My app will soon allow people to advertise unused seats in their car when they travel long distances.
             The free market will determine seat prices, but I expect them to be significantly lower than buses or trains,
             as is the case with similar apps on the European market.
             <br><br>I cannot wait to offer North Americans a cheaper, more environmentally-friendly and convivial way
             to travel with others.

            <h2>Phase 1. Solo</h2>
            <p>Every journey of discovery begins alone and quickly snowballs into a group venture.
            My coding journey started almost three months ago in Montreal with a solo decision to improve my programming
            skills from zero to where they are now.
            <br><br>Fast-forward and I've spent the last two months in London learning to code with
            a wonderful community of like-minded people. It feels amazing to type this HTML right now!

            <h2>Phase 2. Founders & Coders</h2>
            <p>My next phase is joining F&C full-time with the February cohort. I've attended virtually
            every meetup of the last two months and know and love the open, industrious, cross-disciplinary,
            community-driven (but self-directed) atmosphere. I want to keep giving and learning here in London.
            <br><br>My favourite moment thus far has been teaching 25 other F&C community members how to use
            Git and GitHub. Immensely rewarding opportunity to give back to a community that has already given
            me so much - I certainly welcome the chance to give more tutorials to the community in 2017!

            <h2>Phase 3. Start-ups</h2>
            <p>I plan to apply to London-based tech start-ups and mid-sized companies while attending F&C in Q1 2017.
            I want the opportunity to be a big fish in a small pond: to have lots of responsibility, but access to
            experienced coworkers to learn and grow from.
            <br><br>While working in the start-up scene, I want to remain engaged with the rest of the tech community,
            principally through F&C, to continue developing my own app ideas - a sampling of which are listed in the previous
            section.</p>
